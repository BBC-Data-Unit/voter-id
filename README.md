In May 2018 we [followed up on the pilot Voter ID scheme introduced in five English local authorities for the council elections](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44197338).

The data revealed 340 people across Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking were not given their ballot papers because they did not have acceptable ID with them when they went to a polling station.

The councils reported a further 688 people were initially sent away but then returned later in the day with acceptable ID and cast their ballot.

Woking Borough Council also provided a breakdown of the type of ID presented. The most commonly used form was a driving licence, followed by a passport.
